Hi, I'm **Alban** — a software engineer interested in how databases work under the hood.

This blog is a learning journal. Each post documents the implementation of a core database algorithm from first principles — the kind of stuff that powers PostgreSQL, RocksDB, ClickHouse, and Cassandra.

The goal isn't just to write the code. It's to understand *why* each structure exists, what problem it solves, and what tradeoffs it makes.

## The Series

All implementations live in [anocaj/db-internals](https://github.com/anocaj/db-internals) — a C++17 educational repository built week by week.

| Week | Topic | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Hash Index | ✅ Done |
| 2 | LSM Tree | Coming soon |
| 3 | Columnar Storage | Coming soon |
| 4 | Buffer Pool Manager | Coming soon |
| 5 | Query Engine | Coming soon |
| 6 | Concurrency / MVCC | Coming soon |
| 7 | WAL & Recovery | Coming soon |
